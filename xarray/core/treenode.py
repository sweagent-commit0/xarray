class TreeNode(Generic[Tree]):
    """
    Base class representing a node of a tree, with methods for traversing and altering the tree.

    This class stores no data, it has only parents and children attributes, and various methods.

    Stores child nodes in an dict, ensuring that equality checks between trees
    and order of child nodes is preserved (since python 3.7).

    Nodes themselves are intrinsically unnamed (do not possess a ._name attribute), but if the node has a parent you can
    find the key it is stored under via the .name property.

    The .parent attribute is read-only: to replace the parent using public API you must set this node as the child of a
    new parent using `new_parent.children[name] = child_node`, or to instead detach from the current parent use
    `child_node.orphan()`.

    This class is intended to be subclassed by DataTree, which will overwrite some of the inherited behaviour,
    in particular to make names an inherent attribute, and allow setting parents directly. The intention is to mirror
    the class structure of xarray.Variable & xarray.DataArray, where Variable is unnamed but DataArray is (optionally)
    named.

    Also allows access to any other node in the tree via unix-like paths, including upwards referencing via '../'.

    (This class is heavily inspired by the anytree library's NodeMixin class.)
